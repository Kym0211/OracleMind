# OracleMind - Decentralized Prdiction Market with Group Chat
**[Live Demo](https://oracle-mind.vercel.app)**

OracleMind is a **full-stack decentralized prediction market** dApp built on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework for on-chain smart contract logic.
It enables users to connect their Solana wallets, participate in trustless betting markets, and interact socially in real time through a **global group chat** powered by **Supabase Realtime.**

This project combines **Web3 on-chain logic** with **Web2 real-time communication**, showcasing an example of a hybrid dApp architecture.

## Overview

- View **on-chain markets** created via an Anchor Solana program.

- **Bet YES or NO** on market outcomes by staking **SPL tokens** in a decentralized, transparent manner.
